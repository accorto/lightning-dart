The Framework is not dependent on salesforce.com functionality and can be used independently.

The Salesforce Lightning CSS framework is similar to Bootstrap but uses more recent CSS technology and concentrates on building Web Applications, not Web Sites. 

Dart is a Google programming language compiling into Javascript ("Dart - the better Javascript"). 

## Usage

A simple usage example:

    import 'package:lightning_dart/lightning_dart.dart';

    main() {
      var awesome = new Awesome();
    }
